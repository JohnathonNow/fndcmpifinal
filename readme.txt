Q/A:
Q: Why did you decide to make this?
A: I decided to do a Bullet HFIL (the genre, not the title of my project) type game because I
thought it would be fun to make a pretty hard game, one with a lot of bullets on the screen
that requires carefully planned actions and timing.

Q: Why do you keep saying HFIL?
A: It is what they edit the H-word to be in Dragon Ball Z, and I don't plan on using the H-word.

Q: Why the slowing-down time/enemies thing?
A: I'm taking the class Philosophy and Science fiction, and we had to watch The Matrix trilogy.
